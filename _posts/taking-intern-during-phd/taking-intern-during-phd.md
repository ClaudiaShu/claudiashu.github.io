This past summer, I had the chance to take on a full-time internship—and while the experience itself was incredibly rewarding, getting there was far from easy. After I got the offer letter for the position, I quickly realised how tricky it can be to secure approval for a full-time internship position as an international student due to the visa policy. (Many of my peers were doing part-time roles, which tend to be a bit more flexible—so if that works for you and your supervisor’s on board, you’re in good shape!).

The real challenge, surprisingly, came from the visa process—both in obtaining a temporary work visa and then switching back to a student visa afterward. Whether an applicant could apply for either visa from inside the UK was a major point of confusion for everyone involved. Neither my university nor the company seemed to have a clear understanding of how the process actually worked, and there was no legal support team to turn to. I felt like I was figuring it all out in the dark.

That’s exactly why I’m writing this post---to share my experience and offer some guidance to anyone else who might be going through the same thing. If you’re currently stuck in visa limbo or just trying to plan ahead, I hope this helps demystify the process a bit.

# Why is it tricky
Here is my situation:
1. I am an international student.
2. I need to commit to a 90-days internship, and my student visa doesn't allow me to work full time outside term time and I don't have 90-days annual leave.
3. I am studying in a major that requires people with the same ethnic groups as I do need an ATAS, and ATAS needs at least 6 weeks (in reality it is often much longer time than 6 weeks) to be issued.

# What does an immigration advisor does and do you really need one?
My company initially advised me to get an immigration advisor


# Who can apply for change to a temporary work visa from inside UK?
The Home Office had it quite clear on their website, If you have obtained a degree within your past leave to stay (which is the last granted visa) or have completed 2 years of PhD study, you can apply! (please do check the Home Office official page just in case they change the policy) 

The other requirement goes to the company, are they able to legally support the application (You are going to need a SRN sponsorship reference number or CoS certificate of sponsorship)?

Additionally, they also say that the position assigned will not be directly transferred to a permanent work position (fill a full time vacancy)



# Can you apply back to a student visa from inside UK?
Yes!
